# Frontend-SporePay-Bank--2025
This project is part of my frontend development practice, where I created a website for a fictional bank called **SporePay**. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Implemented an interactive design for the homepage.
- Utilized fundamental web development principles to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- All files and styles are available for viewing and running locally or through GitHub Pages.

## How to view and run the project

To see how the website works, simply click on the [GitHub Pages page of this project](https://ShinjiST.github.io/Frontend-SporePay-Bank--2025/). You will be able to view and interact with the website without needing to clone the repository.

Additionally, there is a folder called **`project-screenshots`** in the repository, which contains screenshots of the website, so you can see what the site looks like before running it.
